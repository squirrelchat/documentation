# Contributing Guidelines
Our contributing guidelines are pretty simple, and we expect people to rely on their common sense for the most part.

# NOTE:
The docs are currently heavy WIP. For the meantime, we will not accept any issue or PR.

## Changes we want
 - Fixes of inaccurate statements in the documentation.
 - Clarifications of unclear statements or rewording if appropriated.
 - Fixes of spelling and grammatical mistakes in the documentation.

## Changes we don't want
 - Whitespace or formatting changes.
 - Modifications to the overall structure and format of the API docs.
 - Unnecessary changes that doesn't clarify or complete anything.
 - Additions that replicate or needlessly restructure current documentation.
