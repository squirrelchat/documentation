## Data processing
### Child protection
We are required by law to employ reasonable measures to protect children from getting their personal data processed,
or access parts of the service reserved for more mature audiences (e.g. NSFW channels). We require users to provide
their date of birth during registration to ensure compliance with privacy laws and restrict their access to parts of
the application if necessary.
