This repository contains all the documentation for Squirrel Chat. The entire API is documented for developers to write
integrations or anything their imagination can come up with.

You can access the latest version of the docs at https://squirrel.chat/developers.

# NOTE:
The docs are currently heavy WIP. For the meantime, we will not accept any issue or PR.

## Formatting
The documentation is written in markdown to make it easy to edit for everyone and to use as standalone documents.
However to make rendering the web version easier the documents uses special markdown syntax.

### Linking
TBD

### HTTP Route
TBD

### Alert Boxes
Alert boxes are achieved by using a block quote that has one of 'info', 'warn' or 'danger' on the first line.

### H6 headings
H6 headings should be used above tables and code blocks to properly label them. There should be no text between the
heading and the block.
